			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p><img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" id="profile" align="left">Ever since I was five years-old and received my first gaming console - an old monochrome Game Boy - I have been hooked on video games and their innate ability to immerse audiences in worlds separate from our own. Unlike my friends who simply enjoyed playing games as a means to unwind and pass the time, however, I found myself growing more and more interested in the actual study of video games and those techniques by which developers create digital playgrounds.</p>
				<p>While the interactive nature of games and the puzzling complexity of their design were those elements that originally drew me into the field of Media Studies during college, I soon found myself following the path of an independent developer after graduation. Having joined up with Starboard Games LLC as their PR Lead, I now work alongside the gaming startup's many coders, artists, and writers as their liason to the grander gaming community. During my time with the company, I have developed a web-based publicity campaign while also increasing our social media presence online. As the project has matured, I have also begun organizing and directing our participation in video game conventions as a means to develop interest and prepare us for our eventual crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
				<p> While the work is rewarding, I have found a desire to develop my own coding skills with the ultimate objective of joining in the design process fully. It is for this reason that I have entered into Rutgers' Coding Boot Camp and taken my first steps towards becoming a proficient coder, designer, and developer.</p>
